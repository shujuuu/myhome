# What is the Amenity Service

The `AmenityService` is an interface that defines the operations related to amenities. These operations include creating amenities, getting amenity details, deleting an amenity, listing all amenities, and updating an amenity.

```java
public interface AmenityService {

  Optional<List<AmenityDto>> createAmenities(Set<AmenityDto> amenities, String communityId);

  Optional<Amenity> getAmenityDetails(String amenityId);

  boolean deleteAmenity(String amenityId);

  Set<Amenity> listAllAmenities(String communityId);

  boolean updateAmenity(AmenityDto updatedAmenityDto);
}
```

  private final AmenityRepository amenityRepository;
  private final CommunityRepository communityRepository;
  private final CommunityService communityService;
  private final AmenityApiMapper amenityApiMapper;

  @Override
  public Optional<List<AmenityDto>> createAmenities(Set<AmenityDto> amenities, String communityId) {
    final Optional<Community> community = communityService.getCommunityDetailsById(communityId);
    if (!community.isPresent()) {
      return Optional.empty();
    }
    final List<Amenity> amenitiesWithCommunity = amenities.stream()
        .map(amenityApiMapper::amenityDtoToAmenity)
        .map(amenity -> {
          amenity.setCommunity(community.get());
          return amenity;
        })
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    final List<AmenityDto> createdAmenities =
