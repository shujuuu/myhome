# What is the 'Payment' class

The 'Payment' class is an entity representing a payment in the service. This could be an electricity bill, house rent, water charge etc. It extends the 'BaseEntity' class and includes several fields such as 'paymentId', 'charge', 'type', 'description', 'recurring', 'dueDate', 'admin', and 'member'.

```java
/**
 * Entity identifying a payment in the service. This could be an electricity bill, house rent, water
 * charge etc
 */
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Data
@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = false)
@Entity
public class Payment extends BaseEntity {
  @Column(unique = true, nullable = false)
  private String paymentId;
  @Column(nullable = false)
  private BigDecimal charge;
  @Column(nullable = false)
  private String type;
  @Column(nullable = false)
  private String description;
  @Column(nullable = false)
  private boolean recurring;
  @JsonFormat(pattern = "yyyy-MM-dd")
```

# The main fields and their purpose in the 'Payment' class

The 'Payment' class includes several fields. 'paymentId' is a unique identifier for each payment. 'charge' represents the amount of the payment. 'type' and 'description' provide information about the payment. 'recurring' is a boolean indicating whether the payment is recurring or not. 'dueDate' is the date when the payment is due. 'admin' and 'member' are references to the user who is the admin and the house member associated with the payment respectively.

```java
  @Column(unique = true, nullable = false)
  private String paymentId;
  @Column(nullable = false)
  private BigDecimal charge;
  @Column(nullable = false)
  private String type;
  @Column(nullable = false)
  private String description;
  @Column(nullable = false)
  private boolean recurring;
  @JsonFormat(pattern = "yyyy-MM-dd")
  private LocalDate dueDate;
  @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
