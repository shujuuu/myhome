# Main classes/functions/files related to Booking Controller

The `BookingController` class is defined here. It has a `deleteBooking` method which deletes a booking based on the amenityId and bookingId. The deletion operation is performed by the `BookingService`.

```java
@RestController
@Slf4j
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class BookingController implements BookingsApi {

  private final BookingService bookingSDJpaService;

  @Override
  public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteBooking(@PathVariable String amenityId,
      @PathVariable String bookingId) {
    boolean isBookingDeleted = bookingSDJpaService.deleteBooking(amenityId, bookingId);
    if (isBookingDeleted) {
      return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT).build();
    } else {
      return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).build();
    }
  }
}
```
