# What is the Payment Controller

The `PaymentController` is a REST Controller which provides endpoints for managing payments. It is located in the `com.myhome.controllers` package. The controller is responsible for handling payment-related requests such as scheduling payments, listing payment details, listing all member payments, and listing all admin scheduled payments.

# Main classes/functions/files related to Payment Controller

This is the `PaymentController` class. It contains several methods such as `schedulePayment`, `listPaymentDetails`, `listAllMemberPayments`, and `listAllAdminScheduledPayments`. These methods handle different types of payment-related requests. The `PaymentController` class uses `PaymentService`, `CommunityService`, and `SchedulePaymentApiMapper` to perform its operations.

```java
@RestController
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Slf4j
public class PaymentController implements PaymentsApi {
  private final PaymentService paymentService;
  private final CommunityService communityService;
  private final SchedulePaymentApiMapper schedulePaymentApiMapper;

  @Override
  public ResponseEntity<SchedulePaymentResponse> schedulePayment(@Valid
      SchedulePaymentRequest request) {
    log.trace("Received schedule payment request");

    HouseMember houseMember = paymentService.getHouseMember(request.getMemberId())
        .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException(
            "House member with given id not exists: " + request.getMemberId()));
    User admin = communityService.findCommunityAdminById(request.getAdminId())
        .orElseThrow(
            () -> new RuntimeException("Admin with given id not exists: " + request.getAdminId()));

    if (isUserAdminOfCommunityHouse(houseMember.getCommunityHouse(), admin)) {
```
