# What is the Booking Service

The `BookingService` is an interface that defines the contract for booking related operations. Currently, it only has one method `deleteBooking` which takes an amenityId and a bookingId as parameters.

```java
public interface BookingService {

  boolean deleteBooking(String amenityId, String bookingId);

}
```

# Where the Booking Service is implemented

`BookingService` is implemented in `BookingSDJpaService`. This class uses `AmenityBookingItemRepository` to perform database operations. The `deleteBooking` method is implemented here. It first finds the booking by its id and then checks if the amenity id matches. If it does, it deletes the booking and returns true, otherwise it returns false.

```java
public class BookingSDJpaService implements BookingService {

  private final AmenityBookingItemRepository bookingRepository;

  @Transactional
  @Override
  public boolean deleteBooking(String amenityId, String bookingId) {
    Optional<AmenityBookingItem> booking =
        bookingRepository.findByAmenityBookingItemId(bookingId);
    return booking.map(bookingItem -> {
      boolean amenityFound =
          bookingItem.getAmenity().getAmenityId().equals(amenityId);
      if (amenityFound) {
        bookingRepository.delete(bookingItem);
        return true;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    }).orElse(false);
  }
}
```
