# Main classes/functions/files related to Mail Controller

The `confirmEmail` and `resendConfirmEmailMail` methods in the UserController class are part of the Mail Controller. The `confirmEmail` method is used to confirm the user's email, while the `resendConfirmEmailMail` method is used to resend the confirmation email to the user.

```java
  @Override
  public ResponseEntity<Void> confirmEmail(String userId, String emailConfirmToken) {
    boolean emailConfirmed = userService.confirmEmail(userId, emailConfirmToken);
    if(emailConfirmed) {
      return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
    } else {
      return ResponseEntity.badRequest().build();
    }
  }

  @Override
  public ResponseEntity<Void> resendConfirmEmailMail(String userId) {
    boolean emailConfirmResend = userService.resendEmailConfirm(userId);
    if(emailConfirmResend) {
      return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
    } else {
      return ResponseEntity.badRequest().build();
    }
  }
```
