title: The Impact of HTTP Status Codes on User Experience
---
This document will cover the impact of different HTTP status codes on user experience. We'll cover:

1. What are HTTP status codes
2. How different status codes impact the user experience.

# What are HTTP status codes

HTTP status codes are standard response codes given by web site servers on the internet. They help to identify the cause of the problem when a web page or other resource does not load properly. In Java, these status codes can be handled using various libraries such as Spring's `ResponseEntity` or JAX-RS's `Response`.

# How different status codes impact the user experience

Different status codes have different impacts on the user experience. For example, a 200 OK status code means that the request was successful, and the user can proceed with their intended action. On the other hand, a 404 Not Found status code means that the requested resource could not be found on the server. This could lead to confusion or frustration for the user. In the MyHome project, these status codes are used to communicate the state of the request to the front-end, which then decides how to present this information to the user.
