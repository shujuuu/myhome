# Main classes and methods related to the Amenity Controller

The `AmenityController` class implements the `AmenitiesApi` interface. It has several methods to handle different types of requests such as `getAmenityDetails`, `listAllAmenities`, `addAmenityToCommunity`, `deleteAmenity`, and `updateAmenity`. Each of these methods interacts with the `AmenityService` to perform the necessary operations.

```java
@RestController
@Slf4j
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class AmenityController implements AmenitiesApi {

  private final AmenityService amenitySDJpaService;
  private final AmenityApiMapper amenityApiMapper;

  @Override
  public ResponseEntity<GetAmenityDetailsResponse> getAmenityDetails(
      @PathVariable String amenityId) {
    return amenitySDJpaService.getAmenityDetails(amenityId)
        .map(amenityApiMapper::amenityToAmenityDetailsResponse)
        .map(ResponseEntity::ok)
        .orElse(ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).build());
  }

  @Override
  public ResponseEntity<Set<GetAmenityDetailsResponse>> listAllAmenities(
      @PathVariable String communityId) {
    Set<Amenity> amenities = amenitySDJpaService.listAllAmenities(communityId);
```
